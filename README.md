**Whats new:**

*BatchOS Personality update 2*

*The system has fixed the drag-and-drop window resizing system. A cursor has been added for BatchOS. The original, branded wallpapers for BatchOS have been created. The wallpaper data ID is 1. Previously. The search function has been added to the Start menu, and the "Instance", "BatchBrowser", and "uwpSTUDIO" programs have been added to the store. Now you can create full-fledged and integrated web applications. NOTE: Not all websites can be displayed due to the website's iframe policy. For example, sites like google, youtube, twitter, and github cannot be displayed. This will be resolved in the future.*
